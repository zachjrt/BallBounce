# BallBounce

# Overview
---

This repository contains the source files of my Ball bounce game.

It is essentially a one player pong game. Move the paddle to keep the ball alive, each hit with the paddle grants a point.

The software was written to explore the capabilities of Unity.

Important note. The full project was too large to upload to github. The asset folder containing my code was added. I also added those scripts to the top level for easy access.
